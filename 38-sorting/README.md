# 📚Sorting

**Disclaimer:**

Go provides a package [sort](https://pkg.go.dev/sort) that implements sorting for builtins and user-defined types.

This package is part of the standard library and it is very efficient. So, it is recommended to use it instead of implementing your own sorting algorithm (unless for academic purposes, like this repository).
